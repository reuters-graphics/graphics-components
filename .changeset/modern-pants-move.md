Svelte 5.0+ components.

#### What's in it?

3.0 updates all graphics components to [Svelte 5 syntax](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide).

Components are now only compatible with Svelte 5-based versions of the graphics kit, starting with [1.1.0](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#110).
