Reuters dotcom site header, ported from [Raptor UI components](https://github.com/tr/rcom-arc_raptor-ui/tree/develop/packages/rcom-raptor-ui_common/src/components/site-header).

(Go to the "[Canvas](./?path=/story/components-siteheader--default)" tab to see this component better. It'll look a bit broken below... but it's NOT!)

> **Note:** In the Graphics Kit, you can find this component in `pages/+page.svelte`. Customise it there for the default page.

```svelte
<script>
  import { SiteHeader } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<SiteHeader />
```
