# Headpile

The `Headpile` component is a headshot-bulleted list of people, identifying them with their names, roles and a short description of their significance to a story.

It's designed to be used with headshots that have had their background removed, which can be done in the [Preview app](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/prvw15636/mac?#apd320b3b1b750a4) on macOS.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Headpile } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
  import { assets } from '$app/paths'; // ðŸ‘ˆ If using in the graphics kit...
</script>

<Headpile
  figures={[
    {
      img: `${assets}/images/person-A.jpg`,
      name: 'General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan',
      role: "Sudan's Sovereign Council Chief and military commander",
      text: 'Burhan was little known in public life until taking part in the coup ...',
    },
    {
      img: `${assets}/images/person-B.jpg`,
      name: 'General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo',
      role: 'Leader of the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)',
      text: 'Popularly known as Hemedti, Dagalo rose from lowly beginnings ...',
    },
  ]}
