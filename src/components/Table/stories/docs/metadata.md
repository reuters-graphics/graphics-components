Set the `title`, `dek`, `notes` and `source` options to add supporting metadata above and below the table.

```svelte
<Table
  data="{yourData}"
  title="{'Career home run leaders'}"
  dek="{'In baseball, a home run (also known as a "dinger" or "tater") occurs when a batter hits the ball over the outfield fence. When a home run is hit, the batter and any runners on base are able to score.'}"
  notes="{'Note: As of Opening Day 2023'}"
  source="{'Source: Baseball Reference'}"
/>
```
