# EndNotes

The `EndNotes` component adds notes to the main page such as sources, clarifiying notes and minor corrections that come at the end of a story.

```svelte
<script>
  import { EndNotes } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';

  const notes = [
    {
      title: 'Note',
      text: 'Data is current as of today.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Sources',
      text: 'Data, Inc.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Edited by',
      text: '<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/">Editor</a>, Copyeditor',
    },
  ];
</script>

<EndNotes {notes} />
```

<Canvas of={EndNotesStories.Demo} />

## Using with ArchieML docs

With the Graphics Kit, you'll likely get your text value from an ArchieML doc...

```yaml
# ArchieML doc
[endNotes]
title: Note
text: Data is current as of today

title: Sources
text: Data, Inc.

title: Edited by
text: Editor, Copyeditor
[]
```

... which you'll pass to the `EndNotes` component.

```svelte
<!-- Graphics Kit -->
<script>
  import { EndNotes } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';

  import content from '$locales/en/content.json';
</script>

<EndNotes notes={content.endNotes} />
```
