In addition to images, you can also add videos. These are intentionally simple - they will autoplay, loop and don't support sound.
The way you provide a video is the same as with images, i.e. just give it an `src`, `altText` and `caption` as you would for an image.
The only other thing you need to add is a `type: 'video'`.
