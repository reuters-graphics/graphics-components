# PhotoPack

The `PhotoPack` component makes simple photo grids with custom layouts at various breakpoints.

`images` are defined with their src, alt text, captions and an optional `maxHeight`, which ensures that the images are no taller than that height in any layout.

`layouts` describe how images will be laid out at different breakpoints. The default layout is one photo per row, stacked vertically -- i.e. mobile layout. You can customise the layouts and group images into `rows` above a certain `breakpoint` by specifying the number of images that should go in that row. For example:

```javascript
const layouts = [
  {
    breakpoint: 450,
    rows: [1, 2, 1],
  },
];
```

... tells the component that when the `PhotoPack` container is 450 pixels or wider, it should group the 4 images in 3 rows: 1 in the first, 2 in the second and 1 in the last.

You can define as many layouts for as many images as you like.

```svelte
<script>
  import { PhotoPack } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';

  /** Array of photo metadata */
  const images = [
    {
      src: 'https://...',
      altText: 'Alt text',
      caption: 'Lorem ipsum. REUTERS/Photog',
      // Optional max-height of images across all layouts
      maxHeight: 800,
    },
    // ...
  ];

  /** Set the number of photos in each row at various breakpoints */
  const layouts = [
    {
      breakpoint: 450, // Applies to containers wider than 450px
      rows: [1, 2, 1], // Number of photos in each row
    },
    // Another layout for containers wider than 750px
    { breakpoint: 750, rows: [1, 3] },
  ];
</script>

<PhotoPack {images} {layouts} />
```

## Using with ArchieML docs

With the Graphics Kit, you'll likely get your text value from an ArchieML doc...

```yaml
# ArchieML doc
[blocks]
type: photo-pack
id: my-photo-pack # Optional
class: mb-2 # Optional
width: wide # Optional
textWidth: normal # Optional
gap: 10 # Optional; must be a number.

# Array of image metadata
  [.images]
    src: images/my-img-1.jpg
    altText: Alt text
    caption: Lorem ipsum. REUTERS/Photog

    src: images/my-img-2.jpg
    altText: Alt text
    caption: Lorem ipsum. REUTERS/Photog

    ...
  []

[]
```

... which you'll parse out of a ArchieML block object before passing to the `PhotoPack` component.

> **Important ‚ùó**: The prop `gap` must be a number. ArchieML renders all values -- including numbers -- as strings, so convert the `prop` value to a number before passing it to `PhotoPack`.

```svelte
<!-- App.svelte -->
<script>
  import { PhotoPack } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
  import { assets } from '$app/paths'; // üëà If using in the Graphics Kit...

  import content from '$locales/en/content.json';
</script>

{#each content.blocks as block}
  {#if block.type === 'photo-pack'}
    <!-- Pass `assets` into the image source in Graphics Kit -->
    <PhotoPack
      id={block.id}
      class={block.class}
      width={block.width}
      textWidth={block.textWidth}
      gap={Number(block.gap)}
      images={block.images.map((img) => ({
        ...img,
        src: `${assets}/${img.src}`,
      }))}
      layouts={[
        { breakpoint: 750, rows: [2, 3] },
        { breakpoint: 450, rows: [1, 2, 2] },
      ]}
    />
  {/if}
{/each}
```
