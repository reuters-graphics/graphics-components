Wrap components or other HTML elements to determine if they are visible on the page using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

This is really useful for lazy loading elements, especially expensive media files or components that fetch lots of data. You can also use it trigger animations or play media once a reader scrolls a component into view.

> **Pro tip:** Don't use this for content that's "above the fold" at the top of the page. That'll just slow down the first load of important visible content.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Visible } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<Visible let:visible>
  {#if visible}
    <p>Visible!</p>
  {:else}
    <p>Not yet visible.</p>
  {/if}
</Visible>
```
