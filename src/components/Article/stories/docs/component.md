The `Article` component contains all the content of our story and also establishes the dimensions of our article well, the default central trunk of our page layout.

> 📌 In most cases, **you won't need to mess with the `Article` component** because it's already included in our rigs for you!

```svelte
<script>
  import { Article } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<Article>
  <!-- The story stuff goes in here! -->
</Article>
```
