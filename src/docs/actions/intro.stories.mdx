# Actions

Svelte [actions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/actions) are arbitrary functions that run after Svelte "mounts" an element in the DOM.

But let's try a _less_ technical definition: Svelte actions are extra topping you can add to your HTML once it comes out of the oven.

These are little functions that do little, if often very useful, things on top of your code.

Have a look through the actions we have in this section to get a better idea and watch this space for more TK.
