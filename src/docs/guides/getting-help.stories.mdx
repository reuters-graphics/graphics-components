# Getting help

🚨 **If you're on deadline**, talk to your editor who can point you to the nearest developer.

If you're _off_ deadline, we use GitHub issues to track things that need fixing up or could be improved. Use one of the links below to create a new issue.

It's **very** helpful if you also share a link to any repo you're working in where you've spotted the bug.
