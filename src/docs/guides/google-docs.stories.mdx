# Using with Google docs

Most of the default examples in these docs show how to use components by passing data into them directly through props. In the Kit, though, you likely won't be hard-coding things like text strings in your code and instead will get them from a Google doc.

It's usually easy to use a Google Doc to fill in the props for our components, but it may mean you need to write a tiny bit of code to translate strings from a doc into the data type our component's props expect.

Let's look at a basic component, `ProfileCard`, with a demo that looks like this in the docs:

```svelte
<script>
  import { ProfileCard } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

<ProfileCard
  name="Tom"
  img="{'https://cats.com/cat1.jpg'}"
  birthday="{new Date('2020-09-25')}"
  bio="Some notes.\n\nWith multiple paragraphs."
  isStaff="{true}"
/>
```

The data for the component's props includes strings, a date and a boolean.

In our Google doc, we might fill out a block for this component like this:

```yaml
Type: profile-card
Name: Tom
Image: images/tom-the-cat.jpg
Birthday: 2020-09-25
Bio: Some notes.

With multiple paragraphs.
:end
Staff: true
```

Now we can tie that data into your blocks loop like this:

```svelte
<script>
  // These are usually already imported for you
  import { assets } from '$app/paths';
  import content from '$locales/en/content.json';

  import { ProfileCard } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';
</script>

{#each content.blocks as block}
<!-- ... other blocks -->

{:else if block.Type === 'profile-card'} <ProfileCard name="{block.Name}"
img={`${assets}/${block.Image}`} birthday={new Date(block.Birthday)}
bio="{block.Bio}" isStaff={block.Staff === 'true'} />

<!-- ... other blocks -->
{/each}
```

Notice how we're coercing some of our data from strings into other data types: a boolean for `isStaff`, a date for `birthday` and an absolute path for `img`.
