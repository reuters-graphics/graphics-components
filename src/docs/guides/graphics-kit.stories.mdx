# Using with the Graphics Kit

If you haven't, check out ["Using Reuters Graphics Components" in the Graphics Kit docs](https://reuters-graphics.github.io/docs_graphics-kit/for_developers/graphics-components/) to get a general idea of how to use components.

Look <span class="highlight">for <strong>üöÄ QUICKIT</strong> stories</span> (Quick Kit ü§£üôÑ) for some of our most commonly used components. These stories
include easy copy/paste snippets as well as Google Doc block examples that should
shortcut getting a component working in the Graphics Kit.

## FAQs

### How do I write my Google Doc?

Many component stories show passing data directly into component props. In the Kit, though, you likely won't be hard-coding things like text strings in your code and instead will get them from a Google Doc.

Check out the guide devoted to [using components with Google Docs](?path=/docs/guides-using-with-google-docs--page) for a quick explanation of how to work with Google Docs.

And, of course, look for a QUICKIT story for your component, which will have a Docs example specific to it.

### How do I use this image/video/etc.?

Remember, all references to images, videos and other media must be _absolute paths_:

‚úÖ `https://.../myImage.jpg`

‚ùå `./myImage.jpg`

In most cases, that means you'll need to prefix relative paths with the special `assets` Svelte module. Many examples in these docs show how to do it. But it's also easy enough to demo again here!

```svelte
<script>
  import content from '$locales/en/content.json';
  import { FeaturePhoto } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';

  // This is already imported for you in App.svelte
  import { assets } from '$app/paths';
</script>

{#each content.blocks as block}
<!-- ... other blocks -->

<!-- Use assets to prefix the path to the image. -->
{:else if block.Type === 'photo'} <FeautrePhoto
src={`${assets}/${block.PathToImage}`} /> {/each}
```

### How do I change this component's styles?
