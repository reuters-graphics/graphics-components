## Adding a new chart component

### Prereqs

Before you start, it's probably a good idea to read up a bit on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/svelte/get-started/introduction), the framework used to document components.

### Quickstart

Make a new git branch for your new component, like...

```
git checkout -b my-component
```

This library includes a basic template for creating and documenting your component with Storybook you can use to get started.

Just run...

```
yarn new
```

... which will create a new directory for your component and copy over an example Svelte component and story page.

To start developing your component, start the dev server with...

```
yarn start
```

When you're ready to share your chart, commit your branch to GitHub, make a PR and we'll get it published!

```
git push origin my-chart
```
