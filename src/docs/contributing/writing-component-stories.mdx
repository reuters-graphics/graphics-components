# Writing component stories

As well as writing your component, you should also document how to use it using Storybook "stories."

## What's a story?

Paraphrasing [Storybook's definition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/whats-a-story): A story captures the rendered state of a Svelte component, given certain props. Translation: It's a demo of what your component can do.

In Storybook, you create a story page for your component, which can itself contain several "stories" or demos of how your component works.

To make a story page, you'll create a `*.stories.svelte` and a `*.mdx` file next to your component like this:

```
src/
  components/
    YourComponent/
      YourComponent.mdx
      YourComponent.svelte
      YourComponent.stories.svelte
```

The `*.stories.svelte` component is where you will define the stories or specific demos of your component. The `*.mdx` file is where you can write extended documentation about your component.

## How do I write stories?
