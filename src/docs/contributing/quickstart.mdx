## Adding a new chart component

### Prereqs

Before you start, it's probably a good idea to read up a bit on [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/svelte/get-started/introduction), the framework used to document components.

### Quickstart

Make a new git branch for your new component, like...

```
git checkout -b my-component
```

To start developing your component, start the dev server with...

```
pnpm start
```

When you're ready to share your component, commit your branch to GitHub, make a PR and we'll get it published!

```
git push origin my-component
```
