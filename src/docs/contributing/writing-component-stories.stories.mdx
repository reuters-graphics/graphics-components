# Writing component stories

As well as writing your component, you should also document how to use it using Storybook "stories."

## What's a story?

Paraphrasing [Storybook's definition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/svelte/writing-stories/introduction): A story captures the rendered state of a Svelte component, given certain props. Translation: It's a demo of what your component can do.

In Storybook, you create a story page for your component, which can itself contain several "stories" or demos of how your component works.

To make a story page, you'll create a `*.stories.svelte` file next to your component like this:

```
src/
  components/
    YourComponent/
      YourComponent.svelte
      YourComponent.stories.svelte
```

Your component's story page will then have at least one story that shows how it can be used.

## How do I write stories?

Read through the recipes docs for some common examples of how you may want to write and customise your stories.

If you're comparing the recipes to Storybook's own docs, note that all the examples use "Svelte Native" story format. (Storybook is technically a React-first tool, that's been retrofit to also support a number of other frameworks, including Svelte.)
